#CHOREOGRAPHIC CODING LABS - Mainz 2018

Yhe rationale behind this idea is to generate strange and weird movement from existing movement. This project is composed of two part, the threejs server and the controller (javafx). 

The website is reading .BVH file and you can create new one with the controller. This controller permits to tweak the data of the algorithm used.

Have fun!

WHAT ARE CHOREOGRAPHIC CODING LABS?
The Choreographic Coding Lab (CCL) format offers unique opportunities of exchange and collaboration for digital media ‘code savvy’ artists who have an interest in translating aspects of choreography and dance into digital form and applying choreographic thinking to their own practice. Working with patterns in movement scores and structures through finding, generating and applying them with results ranging from prototypes for artworks to new plug-ins for working with dance related datasets. CCLs also seek to support a sustainable collaborative practice among its participants encouraging ongoing exchange in a growing artistic research community.

CCLs are an outcome of Motion Bank, a four-year research project of The Forsythe Company focused on the creation of on line digital scores with guest choreographers.
